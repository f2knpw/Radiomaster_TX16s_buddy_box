Radiomaster TX16s buddy box (master/trainer and more)

I wanted a wireless buddy box for my Radiomaster TX16s to wireless link two TX16s in Master/Trainer mode.


So decided to build mine with the following specifications:
- cheap (two fully working modules for less than 20$)
- auto configuration as master or slave or vice versa
- auto binding between two modules
- fully hidden into the "external module" compartment (no dangling wire outside the radio))
- no modification into the TX16s
- no firmware modification of your TX16s (stock EdgeTx firmware)
- high speed wireless communication with about 20m range
- automatic On/Off of the buddy boxes via EdgeTx
- extensible to further options (teasing: more to come !)

  All this is open hardware and open source.
  The project is fully described on my Hackaday project page : https://hackaday.io/project/204529-tx16s-buddy-box-wireless-mastertrainer

  PCB is available on PCBWay shared project : https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Radiomaster_TX16s_buddy_box_master_trainer_and_more_9a7ddc8f.html

  It works with ESP32-C3 super mini boards. Source code is here : https://github.com/f2knpw/Radiomaster_TX16s_buddy_box/blob/master/ESP32_C3_TX16s_buddyBox.ino
